when i was young

i believed in all things

hopeful spirits wishing

for our fantasies to come true



loving others and

letting them know

how to love me


quartz monzonite fevers

in the mangled desert

hiding in my windowed cabin


effervescent forests

shouting under the guise of winter


"nobody dreams of you"

these words - remain corrected
