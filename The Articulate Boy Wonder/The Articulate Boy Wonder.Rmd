Banners unfurled by iridescent lights

Scintillating powerful opaline brights

A boy, looking down from a height

Agaze at the audience before him

Only waves of pointy heads, barely dim

Thrusting high, pointing with the right limb

"I AM THE ARTICULATE BOY WONDER

LISTEN AS I BELLOW WITH THUNDER."

Oh no, a squeaky pubescent blunder.
